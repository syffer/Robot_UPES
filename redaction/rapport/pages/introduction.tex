\chapter{Introduction}

As part of my courses at Polytech Nantes, the graduate school of engineering og the University of Nantes, I did a three months abroad internship. 

..

I realised my forth year internship at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), which is based in India, at the Uttarakhand state.

...

I wanted to try this internship in India in order to discover another and totally different culture from mine.
